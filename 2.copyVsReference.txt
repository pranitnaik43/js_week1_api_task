Give a write-up on the Difference between copy by value and copy by reference.

Copy By value
1. When we assign a primitive variable to another variable, it is called copy by value.
2. eg:
var a = 23;
var b = a;
3. In the above example, the value of variable 'a' is copied to variable 'b'.
4. Changing value of variable 'a', won't affect the value of variable 'b' and vice versa.


Copy by reference
1. When we assign a reference variable to another variable, it is called copy by reference.
2. eg:
var p = [1, 2, 3];
var q = p;
3. In the above example, reference of the object (refered to by 'p') is copied to variable q. 
That is, both variable p and q refer to the same object in the memory.
4. If we modify one variable(Let's say q), the same changes reflect for the other variable(q).
